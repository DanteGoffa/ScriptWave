Imagine having an idea for a music video purely based on a song and you want things to happen on specific beats.
You can open an MP3 file in this program and it will be playable over a timeline. Just like video editing software.

Play the music and start tapping on your keyboard to the rythm or on moments where something should happen in the video.
Markers will be placed, each with a textbox where you can type in what should happen on that moment.

When done, you can export a script text file with all the timestamps and their accompanied descriptions of what should happen in the video on that timestamp.

# Little extra info
This was a tiny idea of mine that I didn't spend too much time on. Some features are not half functional and others are not very optimized.
